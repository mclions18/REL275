                    <p>"All missionaries, younger and older, serve with the sole hope of making life better for other people."  - President Russell M. Nelson, (Ask the Missionaries! They Can Help You!, October 2012)

                    "The blessings of missionary service are not only available to those being served, but also encompass those serving who put their heart, might, mind and strength into the work."

                <h3>Scriptures about Repentance</h3>
                <div class="content-pair">
                    <p><strong>1 Nephi 8:12</strong> — "And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we partake in the Joy that comes from living the commandments and the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is nothing that we want to do more than to share that Joy with those around us. The Joy we feel overflows and pushes us to share it with others. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-pair">
                    <p><strong>Alma 29:9</strong> — “I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We can find great Joy in doing the work that the Lord has commanded us to do. We place glory in God and the things he has commanded. When we desire to be an instrument in God's hands we can feel a stronger outpouring of his spirit and a greater desire to share the gospel. We can find Joy in life as we serve others and help them come unto Christ.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-pair">
                    <p><strong>Alma 36:24-26</strong> — "Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors; For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We want to share with all our hearts, the Joy that the gospel brings into our lives. We want others to feel the blessings and power of the gospel and the guidance of the Holy Ghost. When we truly know the things of God, we want others to know just like we do. We do not want others to miss out on the wonderful gifts and blessings that are promised to them.

                <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">My experience with my mission wasn't exactly what I expected it to be. When I went out on my mission I didn't have a very strong testimony of the gospel. I had lots of struggles while out teaching and I felt extremely inadequate, but the Lord strengthened me and helped my testimony grow immensely while out in Brazil. Out in Brazil I found my testimony of the savior and his atonement, and I finally found the courage to fix some things that I didn't fix before leaving on my mission. A few months after going to Brazil I returned home to work on these issues I had not addressed. And after 6 months I was reassigned to the Pocatello Service Mission. This was an absolutely amazing experience. I met so many amazing people and grew in all aspects of my life. I know that my mission greatly blessed my life and I know that without it I would not be in the place I am today.</p>
