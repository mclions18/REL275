            <h2 id="title">Understanding the Doctrine of Repentance</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;">The doctrine of repentance is a vital part of God's Plan for each of us. Only through repenting are we truly able to return to God's presence. God has given us the wonderful gift of repentance because he wants each of us to use it to return to live with him again.</p>

                    <p>"The cleansing gift of repentance allows us to leave our sins behind and emerge a new creature." - Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf

                    "Repentance is not an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind. When coupled with faith, repentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ." - President Russell M. Nelson (We can do better and be better, April 2019)

                <h3>Scriptures about Repentance</h3>
                <div class="content-pair">
                    <p><strong>3 Nephi 27:20</strong> — "Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    God has commanded us to repent and be batized. Through repentance and baptism we can be made clean but we have to start with repentance. When we repent we are able to gain better access to the power of the Holy Ghost to guide and comfort us. Through repentance we can be made spotless before God.

                <div class="content-pair">
                    <p><strong>Alma 34:32</strong> — “For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our time on this Earth is our chance to prepare ourselves to meet God. God has given us this life to learn, grow, and repent. We all will make mistakes but God knows that and gives us the opportunity to repent and learn from those mistakes. As we labor to follow Christ and repent daily we are preparing ourselves to live with God again.

                <div class="content-pair">
                    <p><strong>Moroni 6:8</strong> — "But as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real intent, they were forgiven."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We can be forgiven every time that we make a mistake as long as we choose to repent with real intent and a sincere heart. God will give us as many second chances as we need to turn to him. He loves us and wants us to return to him.
