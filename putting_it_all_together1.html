                    Nothing can separate us from Gods love. Nothing can keep us from the forgiveness that he offers to us. If we choose to follow him he will always forgive us and give us another chance. I love this scripture because it shows how powerful the love of God is and it helps me to feel the power of his atonement, and its ability to bring me to God despite my failings and shortcomings</p>

                <p style="font-size: 24px;">In my own life, I have felt the power of the Atonement during times of deep struggle and repentance. The peace that comes from knowing I can be forgiven and strengthened is something I will always treasure.</p>
